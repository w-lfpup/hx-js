# hx-project

`Hx-project` callbacks dispatch hx-project events.

## about

`Hx-project` event dispatches after a document `fragment` is projected onto the DOM.

Hacker pups can tailor their own hx-project callbacks to create reactive behavior (like adding a css class to trigger animations).

WOOOF!
